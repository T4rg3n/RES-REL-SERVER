# Overview

## What's "ResRel"?

Ressources Relationnelles (or "ResRel" by its nickname) is a year long project for my bachelor's degree. It's a multi-platform application that aims to improve the quality of the relationship between the citizens as well as their personnal knowledge. The entire app is organized around resources, which are the main subject of the app. A resource can be an image, a PDF, a video or a real life event.  

##  About RESREL Server

This repository is the server part of the app, which is a REST API built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com).
It's one of the 3 repos composing *Ressources Relationnelles*, the other ones being [RES-REL-MOBILE](https://github.com/jehanvaire/RES-REL-MOBILE), build with React and React Native for mobile devices (Android & iOS), and [RES-REL-REACT](https://github.com/Pierrick2/res-rel-web-react) built with React for the desktop website.
